# Planetary System Simulator
This is a planetary system toy-simulator, which goal is to visualize a behaviour of modifiable celestial bodies within a single planetary system.

The application is not yet near finished, but at the current state it's at least possible to look at a Earth looking celestial body orbit Sun.
You can also change it's position and velocity and look how it's path is changing!
